This version contains a few minor breaking changes. If you experience 
a problem please report the issue either in the 
[StageXL GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/bp74/StageXL/issues) 
or in the [StageXL Forum](http://www.stagexl.org/forum.html).

#### Pub version 0.9.4+2
  * Fixed an issue with TouchEvents in Dartium.

#### Pub version 0.9.4+1
  * Fixed an issue with WebGL masks in combination with WebGL filters.

#### Pub version 0.9.4
  * Added TouchEvents TOUCH\_ROLL\_OUT, TOUCH\_ROLL\_OVER, TOUCH\_TAP.

  * Fixed TextField.displayAsPassword
  * Improved compatibility for CocoonJS on Android.
  * Changed default value of BitmapDataLoaderOptions.corsEnabled to false.
  * Removed support for Canvas.backingStorePixelRatio.
  
This will be the last version of StageXL with support for IE9. The Dart team 
announced that Dart 1.5 will be the last version with support for IE9.
Therefore the next version of StageXL will take advantage of features (like
typed arrays) which are not supported by IE9. This will presumably improve
the render performance on all other browsers.

#### Pub version 0.9.3+2
  * stageWidth and stageHeight are integers again.

#### Pub version 0.9.3+1
  * Changed Stage.stageWidth and stageHeight to num.

  * Added Mouse.registerCursor for custom cursor styles.
  * Added BitmapData.toDataUrl method.  
  * Added Stage.sourceWidht and Stage.sourceHeight setters.
  * Added Stage.onMouseLeave event.
  * Added BitmapData.sliceIntoFrames margin and spacing parameters.
  * Make CORS for BitmapData loader optional (see BitmapDataLoadOptions).
  * Enabled Stage as mouse and touch event target.
  * Enabled Stage.filters setter (thanks Xavier).
  * Fixed GC issues with WebGL resources.
  * Fixed IE9 render and sound issues.

#### Pub version 0.9.2
  * Added support for Sound Sprits (thanks Alex).

  This version contains major changes in the internal render code.
  The WebGL renderer is highly optimized to draw textures (BitmapDatas) but
  does not support vector graphics yet. If you want to draw Graphics display
  objects please use the applyCache method which renders the vector graphics 
  to a texture or do not opt-in for the WebGL renderer.
