This will be the last version of StageXL with support for IE9. The Dart team 
announced that Dart 1.5 will be the last version with support for IE9.
Therefore the next version of StageXL will take advantage of features (like
typed arrays) which are not supported by IE9. This will presumably improve
the render performance on all other browsers.

  This version contains major changes in the internal render code.
  The WebGL renderer is highly optimized to draw textures (BitmapDatas) but
  does not support vector graphics yet. If you want to draw Graphics display
  objects please use the applyCache method which renders the vector graphics 
  to a texture or do not opt-in for the WebGL renderer.
