/// Holds basic information about an event. 
/// 
/// For many events, such as the events represented by the [Event] class 
/// constants, this basic information is sufficient. Other events, however, may 
/// require more detailed information. Events associated with a mouse click, for 
/// example, need to include additional information about the location of the 
/// click event and whether any keys were pressed during the click event. You 
/// can pass such additional information to event listeners by extending the 
/// Event class, which is what the [MouseEvent] class does.
/// 
/// The methods of the Event class can be used in event listener functions to 
/// affect the behavior of the event object. You can make the current event 
/// listener the last one to process an event by calling the [stopPropagation]
/// or [stopImmediatePropagation] method.
