/// This class is used to create lightweight shapes.

/// The Shape class includes a [graphics] property, which lets you access
/// methods from the [Graphics] class.
/// 
/// The [Sprite] class also includes a graphic sproperty, and it includes other
/// features not available to the [Shape] class. For example, a [Sprite] object
/// is a display object container, whereas a [Shape] object is not (and cannot
/// contain child display objects). For this reason, [Shape] objects consume
/// less memory than [Sprite] objects that contain the same graphics. However, a
/// [Sprite] object supports user input events, while a [Shape] object does not.

  /// Specifies the graphics object belonging to this Shape object, where vector
  /// drawing commands can occur.
